# datafun-04-notebooks

> Practice with various types of notebooks in relation to Python. Covering chapters 7-8 in the textbook, supplementing with learning videos on youtube throughout the week.

# Get started in GitHub

Log in to your GitHub account. 
Create a new GitHub repo named datafun-04-notebooks.
Get started  - on your Machine

On your machine, open VS Code.
In VS Code, select the "Source Code" icon on the left. Git clone your new repo into your Documents folder on your machine.
Ensure your repo has the 3 basic files all our repos need:
a good README.md,
.gitignore, and
about.py. 
Copy these from previous repos as needed.
Update README.md to reflect the focus of this module. 
Add new files to your repo as described below.
Git add, git commit, and git push (commit/sync in VS Code) your updated content to GitHub.

# Goals of Module 4 - notebooks

Explore Chapter 7 - Array-Oriented Programming with NumPy
Explore Chapter 8 - Strings: A Deeper Look
Contrary to the names of the chapters, the most generally useful things here are:

Jupyter - a browser-based environment for processing and presenting analytics. 
We use Jupyter (and the integrated Python and Markup languages) to "tell a story with data"
Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) are great for all steps in a data analytics project:
Defining the question.
Collecting the data.
Exploring and cleaning the data.
Processing and analyzing the data.
Visualizing, reporting, and sharing your results.
The pandas library is widely used. 
The pandas library gives us a Series (for one dimensional data)
It also provides the pandas DataFrame for two-dimensional data (like a spreadsheet). 
It makes it easy to read from files, explore data, and provides a foundation for visualization (e.g., with matplotlib and seaborn).
To get access to these tools, we'll go beyond the Python Standard Library and install additional, external libraries. 
Before we can import them, we must first download and install them into our active Python environment (if using conda, this is typically the 'base' or default environment).
It's possible to have many different Python virtual environments, each with a specific Python version and set of libraries installed. In this course we just use base - do a web search to learn more. 

# """Nic Vetter - 9/7/2023 - American Football

Since I am a big football fan, I have decided to switch my domain from Agriculture to American Football. The reason I did this 
is because I have found it difficult to apply the concepts covered in class to the Agriculture world. This folder will show proficiencies in using notebooks
in relation to python."""
